- **Production-ready build configuration**

## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your production values
```

### 2. Database Setup
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster configured for production
- [ ] Database connection string updated in .env
- [ ] Database indexes created for performance
- [ ] Backup strategy configured

### 3. Security Configuration
- [ ] JWT secrets generated (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] CORS origins configured for your domain
- [ ] Rate limiting thresholds set appropriately
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates configured
- [ ] Firewall rules configured

### 4. Third-Party Services
- [ ] Cloudinary account configured for image storage
- [ ] Paystack live keys configured for payments
- [ ] Twilio configured for SMS verification
- [ ] SendGrid configured for email notifications
- [ ] OpenAI API key configured for AI features

### 5. Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry recommended)
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Log aggregation configured
- [ ] Health check endpoints tested

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Backend Deployment

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd swaap-backend
npm install

# 2. Build the application
npm run build

# 3. Start production server
npm start
```

### Frontend Deployment

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd SwaapFrontend
npm install

# 2. Build for production (Expo)
expo build:android
expo build:ios

# Or build for web
expo build:web
```

## 🔍 Health Checks

After deployment, verify these endpoints:

- `GET /` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/status` - Detailed system status
- `GET /api/config/server-info` - Server configuration
- Test authentication endpoints
- Test file upload functionality
- Verify rate limiting is working

## 📊 Monitoring Endpoints

The app now includes comprehensive monitoring:

- **Logs**: Check logs/ directory for structured logging
- **Performance**: Memory usage and response times tracked
- **Security**: Authentication attempts and suspicious activity logged
- **Business**: User actions and system events tracked

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit secrets** - All sensitive data is now in .env.example as templates
2. **Change default passwords** - Update admin credentials immediately
3. **Enable HTTPS** - Configure SSL/TLS certificates
4. **Monitor logs** - Set up log alerts for suspicious activity
5. **Regular updates** - Keep dependencies updated

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations Active

- ✅ **Memory monitoring** - Automatic cleanup when memory usage is high
- ✅ **Response caching** - 5-minute TTL for frequently accessed data
- ✅ **Image optimization** - Automatic compression and resizing
- ✅ **Database optimization** - Query performance tracking
- ✅ **Request optimization** - Response time monitoring

## 🛟 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Server won't start**: Check .env configuration and MongoDB connection
2. **High memory usage**: Memory monitoring will log warnings and trigger cleanup
3. **Slow responses**: Check performance logs for bottlenecks
4. **Security errors**: Check security logs for blocked requests
5. **Authentication issues**: Verify JWT secrets and token expiration

### Log Locations:
- **Error logs**: `logs/error.log`
- **Security logs**: `logs/security.log`
- **Combined logs**: `logs/combined.log`
- **Console**: Development only, production uses Winston
